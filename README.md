# ADF Refresh

If you directly or indirectly works with Oracle ADF pages, and are annoyed removing query parameters to refresh the page, then this add-on is for you.

It refreshes the page after removing all the query parameters. It can save you a lot of time.

Caution: The logic just removes all the query parameters and refreshes the page. Be cautious on pages other than ADF.
